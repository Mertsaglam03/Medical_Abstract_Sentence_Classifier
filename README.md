PubMed 200k RCT Sequential Sentence Classification
Overview
This GitHub repository encapsulates the implementation of a deep learning model inspired by the 2017 paper "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts." The project focuses on exploring the potential of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in classifying sequential sentences within medical abstracts.

Key Features
Dataset: Utilizes the PubMed 200k RCT dataset, containing approximately 200,000 labeled Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts.
Objective: Replicates the deep learning model from the paper to classify sentences into categories such as background, objective, methods, results, and conclusions.
Experiments: Conducts six different experiments exploring various pre-trained models, self-made models, and different embedding layer configurations.
Technical Details
The project involves:

Tokenization and Embeddings: Implements tokenization techniques to convert words into numerical representations and explores various methods for creating embeddings.
Model Architecture: Develops deep learning architectures with different configurations, leveraging both pre-trained and self-made models.
Experiments: Conducts six experiments, systematically varying pre-trained models, self-made models, and embedding layer configurations to evaluate performance.

Results and Contributions
The repository includes detailed documentation on experimental results, providing insights into the effectiveness of different models and embedding strategies. Contributions and discussions are encouraged to foster collaboration and advancement in the application of NLP to medical research.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and utilize this repository as a resource for understanding and implementing sequential sentence classification in the medical domain using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued!
